This is my integration project from my first software engineering class. I was working at a mexican restruant at the time, and did not know what to do for my project, so i decided to make an order claculator system with items from work.
The program starts by greeting the user and printing the menu of tacos while prompting them to enter the number of their desired choice. The user will enter the number of the item they choose, then the program will ask the user if they would like to add another item. 
The program will keep asking ther user if they would like to add another item, until they enter no. Once the user decides they do not want any more items, the program displays the total, and asks if they would like to add a tip. 
If the user enters yes that they would like to add a tip, the system displays common tip percentages (15%, 18%, 20%) applied to the users total, so there is no math required, unless they would like to tip greater than 20%. However, the system prompts them to enter the tip amount, so they can enter any amount they choose. 
If the user enters a tip, the system displays a thank you message, along with their new total with their tip included. The program then displays a final thank you message telling you to enjoy and showing your new total.
